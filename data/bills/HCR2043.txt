(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona, the Senate concurring:
1.Article IV, part 1, section 1, Constitution of
Arizona, is proposed to be amended as follows if approved by the voters and on
proclamation of the Governor:
START_STATUTE1.Legislative authority; initiative and
referendum
Section1.(1)Senate;
house of representatives; reservation of power to people.The
legislative authority of the state shall be vested in the legislature,
consisting of a senate and a house of representatives, but the people reserve
the power to propose laws and amendments to the constitution and to enact or
reject such laws and amendments at the polls, independently of the legislature;
and they also reserve, for use at their own option, the power to approve or
reject at the polls any act, or item, section, or part of any act, of the
legislature.
(2)Initiative
power.The first of these reserved powers is the initiative. Under
this power ten per centum percent of the qualified
electors shall have the right to propose any measure, and fifteen per centum percent shall have the right to propose any
amendment to the constitution.
(3)Referendum
power; emergency measures; effective date of acts. The second of these
reserved powers is the referendum. Under this power the legislature, or five per centum percent of the qualified electors, may order
the submission to the people at the polls of any measure, or item, section, or
part of any measure, enacted by the legislature, except laws immediately necessary
for the preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or for the support
and maintenance of the departments of the state government and state
institutions; but to allow opportunity for referendum petitions, no act passed
by the legislature shall be operative for ninety days after the close of the
session of the legislature enacting such measure, except such as require
earlier operation to preserve the public peace, health, or safety, or to
provide appropriations for the support and maintenance of the departments of
the state and of state institutions; provided, that no such emergency measure
shall be considered passed by the legislature unless it shall state in a
separate section why it is necessary that it shall become immediately
operative, and shall be approved by the affirmative votes of two-thirds of the
members elected to each house of the legislature, taken by roll call of ayes
and nays, and also approved by the governor; and should such measure be vetoed
by the governor, it shall not become a law unless it shall be approved by the
votes of three-fourths of the members elected to each house of the legislature,
taken by roll call of ayes and nays.
(4)Initiative
and referendum petitions; filing.All petitions submitted under the
power of the initiative shall be known as initiative petitions, and shall be
filed with the secretary of state not less than four months preceding the date
of the election at which the measures so proposed are to be voted upon. All
petitions submitted under the power of the referendum shall be known as
referendum petitions, and shall be filed with the secretary of state not more
than ninety days after the final adjournment of the session of the legislature
which shall have passed the measure to which the referendum is applied. The
filing of a referendum petition against any item, section, or part of any
measure shall not prevent the remainder of such measure from becoming
operative.
(5)Effective
date of initiative and referendum measures. Any measure or amendment to the
constitution proposed under the initiative, and any measure to which the
referendum is applied, shall be referred to a vote of the qualified electors,
and shall become law when approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon and
upon proclamation of the governor, and not otherwise.
(6)(A)Veto
of initiative or referendum.The veto power of the governor shall
not extend to an initiative measure approved by a majority of the votes cast
thereon or to a referendum measure decided by a majority of the votes cast
thereon.
(6)(B)Legislature's
power to repeal initiative or referendum. The legislature shall not have the
power to repeal an initiative measure approved by a majority of the votes cast
thereon or to repeal a referendum measure decided by a majority of the votes
cast thereon.
(6)(C)Legislature's power to amend
initiative or referendum.For
initiative and referendum measures approved from 1998 through 2014, the
legislature shall not have the power to amend an initiative measure approved by
a majority of the votes cast thereon, or to amend a referendum measure decided approved by a majority of the votes cast
thereon, unless the amending legislation furthers the purposes of such measure
and at least threefourths of the members of each house of the
legislature, by a roll call of ayes and nays, vote to amend such measure, except that for measures approved at the 2016 general
election or later, the legislature shall not have the power to amend an
initiative or a referendum measure approved by a majority of the votes cast
thereon, unless the legislature approves the amendment by a greater percentage
of the members of the legislature than the percentage of voters that approved
the initiative or referendum measure and, if the initiative or referendum
measure was approved by at least twothirds of the votes cast thereon,
the amending legislation furthers the purposes of such measure.
(6)(D)Legislature's
power to appropriate or divert funds created by initiative or referendum. For initiative and referendum measures

the power to appropriate or divert funds created or allocated to a specific
purpose by an initiative measure approved by a majority of the votes cast
thereon, or by a referendum measure decided

the votes cast thereon, unless the appropriation or diversion of funds furthers
the purposes of such measure and at least threefourths of the members of
each house of the legislature, by a roll call of ayes and nays, vote to
appropriate or divert such funds,
Except that for measures approved at the 2016 general election or later, the
legislature shall not have the power to divert funds created or allocated to a
specific purpose by an initiative or a referendum measure approved by a
majority of the votes cast thereon, unless the legislature approves the
diversion of funds by a greater percentage of the members of the legislature
than the percentage of voters that approved the initiative or referendum
measure and, if the initiative or referendum measure was approved by at least
two-thirds of the votes cast thereon, the diversion of funds furthers the
purposes of such measure.

general laws to legislate.Such incorporated cities, towns, and
counties may prescribe the manner of exercising said powers within the

qualified elector of the state, or in the case of a city, town, or county
measure, of the city, town, or county affected by the measure so proposed to be
initiated or referred to the people.

measure, together with the words "yes" and "no" in such
manner that the electors may express at the polls their approval or disapproval
